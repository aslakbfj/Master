Welcome to the Logic Explained Networks (LENs)
=======

![](len.jpg)

The Logic Explained Network is a python repository providing a set of utilities and modules to
build deep learning models that are explainable by design.
This library provides both already implemented LENs classes and APIs classes to get First-Order Logic (FOL) explanations from neural networks.
Paper

The idea proposed in this library has been published in the [Logic
Explained
Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000437022200162X)
paper, published in the Artificial Intelligence journal.

Example
=======

### Import LENs

``` {.python}
import lens
import torch
```

### Create train, validation and test datasets

Let's create a XOR-like datasets with 2 redundant features (the 3rd and
4th).

``` {.python}
lens.utils.base.set_seed(0)
x = torch.rand([100, 4])
y = (x[:, 0] > 0.5) & (x[:, 1] < 0.5) | \
    (x[:, 0] < 0.5) & (x[:, 1] > 0.5)

data = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(x, y)

train_data, val_data, test_data = torch.utils.data.random_split(data, [80, 10, 10])
x_train, y_train = data[train_data.indices]
x_val, y_val = data[val_data.indices]
x_test, y_test = data[test_data.indices]
```

### Instantiate a MuNN 

``` {.python}
model = lens.models.XMuNN(n_classes=2, n_features=4,
                          hidden_neurons=[10], loss=torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss())
```

### Train the model 
``` {.python}
model.fit(train_data, val_data, epochs=100, l_r=0.1)

## get accuracy on test samples
test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data)
print("Test accuracy:", test_acc)
```

    Epoch: 1/100, Loss: 0.733, Tr_acc: 46.88, Val_acc: 53.00, best_e: -1

    Epoch: 48/100, Loss: 0.144, Tr_acc: 97.12, Val_acc: 93.00, best_e: -1
    Epoch: 49/100, Loss: 0.139, Tr_acc: 97.12, Val_acc: 93.00, best_e: -1

    Test accuracy: 99.0

### Extract and evaluate global explanation

``` {.python}
## get first order logic explanations for a specific target class
target_class = 1
concept_names = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4']
formula = model.get_global_explanation(x_train, y_train, target_class,
                                       top_k_explanations=2, concept_names=concept_names)
print(f"{formula} <-> f{target_class}")

## compute explanation accuracy
exp_accuracy, _ = lens.logic.test_explanation(formula, target_class, x_test, y_test,
                                              concept_names=concept_names)
print("Logic Test Accuracy:", exp_accuracy)
```

    (x1 & ~x2) | (x2 & ~x1) <-> f1
    Logic Test Accuracy: 100.0

```
### data
It contains some functions to download and structure the datasets as used in the experiments

### examples
It contains the simple ``xor_example`` reported above, explaining how to train and extract FOL explanations of a LEN.  
Several examples on how to extract explanations from any models are reported in ``api_examples``

### experiments
Here are reported the notebooks used in the paper to test the models. each notebook contains the comparison on one dataset.
Also you can find the exp. against adversarial attacks on cub ``cub_adv.ipynb``, 
the exp. on explaining a black-box models on mimic ``mimic_ebb.ipynb``, and the experiment on interpretable clustering ``mnist_iclu.ipynb``.

### lens.models
The most important folder is of course ``lens.models`` where you can find all the proposed Logic Explained Networks: 
*   The $\psi$ Network 
*   The $\mu$ Network 
*   The ReLu Network. 

These models are explainable by design and they all offer two methods to extract explanations:
*   ``.get_local_explanation()`` which returns the local explanation for one sample prediction
*   ``.get_global_explanation()`` which returns the global explanation for an entire class

Also, in models are implemented a number of white-box classifiers and provide the same functions. 
Among others, *BRL*, *Decision tree*, *Logistic regression*, 
a black box model explained with *Anchors*, and *Deep Red* (the implementation of the latter has still some issues).

In the same folder are also reported two black box models *Random forest* and a *Black-box* NN. 

Finally a *Robust CNN* is reported. It employs the explanations of a LEN to defend from adversarial attacks. 

### lens.logic
In this folder we implemented all the API required to extract FOL explanations of a model. 
Most of the functions are not-strcitly related with any model and therefore can be also used in general as reported in ``examples.api_examples``.

### lens.utils
Here are reported several utilities functions used in the models and in the experiments. 
An important utility file is ``lens.utils.dataset``. 
It contains all the dataset classes used to implement the different concept bottleneck architectures.

### tests
Testing utilities of the main functions and classes.
